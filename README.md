🔐 LSB Steganography using C (BMP Image)
📌 Project Overview

This project implements LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography in C to securely hide and extract secret data inside BMP images.

The application supports both:

Encoding: Hiding a secret file inside an image
Decoding: Extracting the hidden data from the image

A magic string authentication mechanism is used to ensure secure access while decoding.

⚙️ Features
Encode secret data into .bmp images
Decode hidden data from stego images
Supports any file type (via extension encoding)
Magic string protection for secure decoding
Efficient bit-level manipulation using LSB technique
Command-line based execution
🛠️ Technologies Used
C Programming
File Handling (fopen, fread, fwrite)
Bit Manipulation
BMP Image Format Handling
🧠 How It Works
🔸 Encoding Process
Reads the source BMP image
Accepts a secret file and magic string
Checks if the image has enough capacity
Encodes:
Magic string size and data
File extension
Secret file size
Secret file data
Generates a stego image with hidden data
🔸 Decoding Process
Opens the stego image
Skips BMP header
Extracts:
Magic string size and data
Verifies user-entered magic string
Extracts:
File extension
Secret data size
Secret data
Reconstructs the original secret file

▶️ How to Compile
gcc *.c -o stego
🚀 How to Run
🔹 Encoding
./stego -e <input.bmp> <secret_file> [output.bmp]

Example:

./stego -e input.bmp secret.txt output.bmp
🔹 Decoding
./stego -d <stego.bmp> [output_file]

Example:

./stego -d output.bmp decoded.txt
🔐 Security Feature
Uses a Magic String as a password
Decoding proceeds only if the entered string matches the encoded one
📌 Example

Secret file:

"My password is SECRET ;)"

After encoding → hidden inside image
After decoding → original file is reconstructed
